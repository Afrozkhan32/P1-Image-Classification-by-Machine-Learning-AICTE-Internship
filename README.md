# P1-Image-Classification-by-Machine-Learning-AICTE-Internship

It sounds like you're describing a project that integrates two powerful deep learning models (MobileNetV2 and CIFAR-10) for image classification using Streamlit for a web application. Here's a clean breakdown and explanation of the project:

---

### **Implementation of ML Model for Image Classification with Streamlit**

#### **Overview**
This project is a Streamlit app designed for real-time image classification. The app integrates two models:
- **MobileNetV2**: A lightweight neural network model pre-trained on ImageNet, capable of classifying 1,000 different object categories, such as animals, vehicles, and everyday objects.
- **CIFAR-10 Model**: A custom model trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, specialized in recognizing 10 different categories, including airplanes, automobiles, birds, etc.

Users can upload images and get predictions from either model along with confidence scores. The app features an intuitive navigation bar for easy switching between models and offers real-time results, making it suitable for educational purposes and practical image classification tasks.

#### **Key Features**
- **Dual Model Support**:
  - **MobileNetV2**: Ideal for classifying a wide range of general objects from ImageNet.
  - **CIFAR-10 Model**: Optimized for classifying images into specific categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  
- **Intuitive Interface**:
  - **Navigation Bar**: Allows users to easily switch between the MobileNetV2 model and the CIFAR-10 model.
  - **Real-Time Classification**: Instantly upload an image and receive classification predictions with confidence scores.

- **Educational and Practical Use**:
  - Great for learning about machine learning and deep learning models.
  - Useful for real-world applications where you need to classify images quickly.

#### **Getting Started**

##### **Prerequisites**
1. Python 3.7 or later
2. A web browser (for viewing the Streamlit app)

##### **Installation Steps**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JayRathod341997/DeepLensX.git
   cd Implementation-of-ML-model-for-image-classification
   ```
   
2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   - For macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - For Windows:
    
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
    
     
   
3. **Install the required dependencies**:
 
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. **Run the Streamlit app**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

5. **Open the app**: After running the command, the app should open automatically in your default web browser. If not, manually open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501).
